# Crumble

## with the deprecation of Phoenix.View and its replacement with Phoenix.HTML, the use for this library has probably passed.

by adding `crumble` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir

```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
